# Task 3 – SMB Enumeration

## Target
Target: 192.168.0.128 (Metasploitable2 VM)
Focus: Service Enumeration (SMB – Ports 139, 445)
Toolset: Nmap, smbclient, enum4linux, smbmap  


## Commands Used

1. Nmap SMB Script
nmap -p 139,445 --script smb-os-discovery 192.168.0.128

Findings:

Detected Samba service running on target

Reported OS and domain/workgroup info

Confirmed SMB version

2. smbclient (Anonymous Listing)
smbclient -L \\192.168.0.128 -N

Findings:

Able to list available SMB shares without authentication

Shares identified included:

tmp (read/write access possible)

IPC$ (inter-process communication)

Anonymous access suggests misconfiguration

3. enum4linux
enum4linux -a 192.168.0.128

Findings:

Enumerated users and groups on the system

Confirmed shares from smbclient

Extracted additional details (NetBIOS name, OS info, possible policies)

Valuable for building a user list → potential brute force

4. smbmap
smbmap -H 192.168.0.128

Findings:

Displayed share permissions

Confirmed tmp share is world-writable

Demonstrates possible file upload → privilege escalation / remote code execution path


## Observations
- Writable shares may allow file upload or privilege escalation.
- User/group info may be harvested via enum4linux.

## Takeaways
- System has risk of privilege escalation, information is disclosed such as user names, and certain software is exploitable.

## Next Steps
- Attempt file upload/download in writable shares.
- Consider password brute-forcing with Hydra/Medusa (later module).
