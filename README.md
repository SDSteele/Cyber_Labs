# Cybersecurity Labs Portfolio
A collection of hands-on cybersecurity projects I've built in my home lab.  
This repo documents my journey in pentesting, network scanning, and exploit development.  

## Projects
- [Nmap Scans](./nmap) → Recon of local lab machines with different scan types.
- [Metasploit Exploits](./metasploit) → Sample exploitation and privilege escalation.
- [Reports](./reports) → Formal writeups formatted like professional pentest reports.
- [Notes](./notes)

## Goals
- Build practical pentesting skills (recon → exploit → report).
- Develop strong technical documentation habits.
- Showcase projects for future employers.
