Penetration Test Report Template

Author: Shannon Steele
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Target: (VM name, IP, or system)
Lab Environment: (Home lab, VM, isolated test network)

1. Executive Summary

Plain-language summary of what you did and what you found.

Target system was scanned and tested for vulnerabilities.

Several open ports and outdated services were identified.

One critical vulnerability was successfully exploited.

This section is for non-technical readers (like managers).

2. Scope

Target IP(s): xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

Tools Used: (e.g., Nmap, Metasploit, Nikto, Hydra, Burp Suite)

Testing Window: (date/time)

Rules of Engagement: (lab only, no production systems)

3. Methodology

Step-by-step phases of your test.

Reconnaissance: Used Nmap to identify open ports and services.

Scanning & Enumeration: Identified software versions, possible vulnerabilities.

Exploitation: Attempted to exploit MS08-067 SMB vulnerability with Metasploit.

Post-Exploitation: Verified access and privilege escalation.

Reporting: Documented findings.

4. Findings
ðŸ”´ High Risk

Vulnerability: MS08-067 SMB Remote Code Execution

Impact: Remote attacker can gain full system access.

Evidence: Exploited via Metasploit, obtained shell.

Recommendation: Apply Microsoft patch KB958644 or disable vulnerable service.

ðŸŸ  Medium Risk

Vulnerability: Anonymous FTP login

Impact: Unauthenticated access to FTP directories.

Recommendation: Disable anonymous login or restrict via firewall.

ðŸŸ¢ Low Risk

Vulnerability: Outdated Apache HTTPD version

Impact: May be vulnerable to known exploits.

Recommendation: Update to latest stable version.

5. Screenshots / Evidence

(Insert screenshots or output snippets here â€” nmap results, Metasploit shell, etc.)

6. Conclusion

The target VM was successfully compromised.

This demonstrates the importance of patching and service hardening.

Further testing should include web application analysis and privilege escalation.

7. Appendix

Command Log: Include key commands used.

Tool Configs: Any special settings.
